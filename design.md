The composter has the following systems:

* Controllable valve to renew air. This sytem must have a filtration system.
* Air circulation system.
* Basic sensor system
  * Compost soil
    * pH
    * Temperature
    * Humidity
  * Compost air
    * Temperature
    * Humidity
    * $O2$
    * $H_2S$: Hydfrogen Sulfide (biproduct of anaerobic decomposition)
    * $CH_4$: Methane
    * Ammonia
* Advanced sensing system
  * Raman or LIBS spectroscopy
    * $ZnSe$ window for Raman soil analysis
    * [determine compost maturity using spectroscopy](https://www.intechopen.com/books/organic-fertilizers-from-basic-concepts-to-applied-outcomes/compost-process-and-organic-fertilizers-application-in-china)
  * Raman gas analysis
* Shredder
* Heating/cooling system
* $H_2O$ capture and delivery
  * Controllable valve to condensation system for compost air 
  * Controllable valve to watering system
* BSFL system
  * Reproduction chamber
  * Escape system for larvae

## Questions

* Does it matter that air from different compost bins mix? What about their dirt and microcosms?
