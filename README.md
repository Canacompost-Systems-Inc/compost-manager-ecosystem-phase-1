# Compost Management Ecosystem

This repository contains all work related to my group's entry in the CSA/NASA 2021 Deep Space Food Challenge.

Submodules:

* The final report is available in the [deep-space-food-challenge-report](https://github.com/leomorpho/deep-space-food-challenge-report/) 
* Software for our prototype is available in the [compost-manager-pi](https://github.com/leomorpho/compost-manager-pi) and [compost-manager-embedded](https://github.com/leomorpho/compost-manager-embedded) submodules. The first one runs a manager process on a Raspberry Pi while the second runs a slave microcontroller. This system can control the environmental conditions of a completely closed compost bin.
